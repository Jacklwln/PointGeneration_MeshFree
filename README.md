# Generation of cloud of points
This program generates a cloud of points of complex two-dimensional geometries using quadtrees. 
This cloud of points can be used in meshfree methods for numerical flow simulation over that geometry.

This program is an implementation of the following paper:
> Point Distribution generation using heirarchical Data Structures
> (U. Mohan Varma, S.V. Raghurama Rao and S.M. Deshpande)
